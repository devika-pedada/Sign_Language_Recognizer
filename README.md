# Sign_Language_Recognizer
This project is a sign language recognizer that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize signs. The project is designed using Python libraries Tensorflow and Keras, and the MNIST Sign language dataset is used to train the model.

## Features
- Recognizes sign language gestures accurately using convolutional neural networks
- Designed and implemented our own model using Tensorflow and Keras libraries
- Utilizes the MNIST Sign language dataset to train the model
- Achieves high accuracy on test dataset
- Easy to use and integrate with your own projects

## Usage
- The system takes in input images of sign language gestures and returns the corresponding sign language symbol
- The model can be easily integrated with your own projects for sign language recognition
- Further it is being tested on video input, but at present is getting low accuracy

## Contributing
- If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request
- All contributions are welcome, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements to the documentation
